Given the structure of your CommandsInput class, which contains separate lists for each command type (like Search, Select, etc.), sorting commands by their timestamps becomes a bit more complex. Since these commands are in separate lists, you'll need to merge them into a single list and then sort that list. Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:
1. Create a Common Interface or Base Class

Ensure that all your command classes (like Search, Select, etc.) either implement a common interface or extend a base class that includes a method to get the timestamp. For instance, if Command is your base class, it should have a getTimestamp() method.

java

public abstract class Command {
public abstract Integer getTimestamp();
}

Make sure all subclasses implement or inherit this method.
2. Merge All commands into a Single List

You need to merge all the separate command lists into a single list. This can be done by iterating over each list in CommandsInput and adding all elements to a new list.

java

List<Command> allCommands = new ArrayList<>();
allCommands.addAll(commandsInput.getSearches());
allCommands.addAll(commandsInput.getSelects());
// Add elements from other command lists in the same manner

3. Sort the Combined List

Now that you have a single list containing all commands, you can sort it using the timestamp:

java

Collections.sort(allCommands, Comparator.comparing(Command::getTimestamp));

4. Process Sorted commands

After sorting, you can iterate over this list to process the commands in the order of their timestamps.
Alternative Approach: Using Java Streams

An alternative and more streamlined way to merge and sort the lists is to use Java Streams:

java

import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

// ...

List<Command> allCommands = Stream.of(
commandsInput.getSearches().stream(),
commandsInput.getSelects().stream(),
// Include streams from other command lists
)
.flatMap(stream -> stream)
.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Command::getTimestamp))
.collect(Collectors.toList());

This approach uses Stream.of() to create a stream of streams, flatMap to merge them into a single stream, and then sorts and collects the results into a list.
Conclusion

These approaches will allow you to process commands in the order of their timestamps regardless of the command type. It's important to ensure that all command classes have a consistent way of returning their timestamp for the sorting to work correctly.
