Given the structure of your CommandsInput class, which contains separate lists for each command type (like Search, Select, etc.), sorting commands by their timestamps becomes a bit more complex. Since these commands are in separate lists, you'll need to merge them into a single list and then sort that list. Hereâ€™s how you can approach it:
1. Create a Common Interface or Base Class

Ensure that all your command classes (like Search, Select, etc.) either implement a common interface or extend a base class that includes a method to get the timestamp. For instance, if Command is your base class, it should have a getTimestamp() method.

java

public abstract class Command {
public abstract Integer getTimestamp();
}

Make sure all subclasses implement or inherit this method.
2. Merge All commands into a Single List

You need to merge all the separate command lists into a single list. This can be done by iterating over each list in CommandsInput and adding all elements to a new list.

java

List<Command> allCommands = new ArrayList<>();
allCommands.addAll(commandsInput.getSearches());
allCommands.addAll(commandsInput.getSelects());
// Add elements from other command lists in the same manner

3. Sort the Combined List

Now that you have a single list containing all commands, you can sort it using the timestamp:

java

Collections.sort(allCommands, Comparator.comparing(Command::getTimestamp));

4. Process Sorted commands

After sorting, you can iterate over this list to process the commands in the order of their timestamps.
Alternative Approach: Using Java Streams

An alternative and more streamlined way to merge and sort the lists is to use Java Streams:

java

import java.util.stream.Stream;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

// ...

List<Command> allCommands = Stream.of(
commandsInput.getSearches().stream(),
commandsInput.getSelects().stream(),
// Include streams from other command lists
)
.flatMap(stream -> stream)
.sorted(Comparator.comparing(Command::getTimestamp))
.collect(Collectors.toList());

This approach uses Stream.of() to create a stream of streams, flatMap to merge them into a single stream, and then sorts and collects the results into a list.
Conclusion

These approaches will allow you to process commands in the order of their timestamps regardless of the command type. It's important to ensure that all command classes have a consistent way of returning their timestamp for the sorting to work correctly.

please implement searchSongs
this is how a song can look like:
{
"name": "Shape of You",
"duration": 233,
"album": "Divide",
"tags": [
"#pop",
"#mostlistenedthisyear",
"#spotify"
],
"lyrics": "The club isn't the best place to find a lover, So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)",
"genre": "Pop",
"releaseYear": 2017,
"artist": "Ed Sheeran"
}

a filter can exist for any of these
ChatGPT

To implement the searchSongs method in your Library class, you will need to filter the list of songs based on the criteria specified in the filters map. Each entry in the filters map corresponds to a potential property of a Song object, like name, album, genre, etc.

Here's an example of how you might implement the searchSongs method:

java

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

// ... other imports ...

public class Library {
// ... existing fields and methods ...

    private List<String> searchSongs(Map<String, Object> filters) {
        return songs.stream()
                .filter(song -> matchesFilters(song, filters))
                .map(Song::getName)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    private boolean matchesFilters(Song song, Map<String, Object> filters) {
        for (Map.Entry<String, Object> filter : filters.entrySet()) {
            switch (filter.getKey().toLowerCase()) {
                case "name":
                    if (!song.getName().contains((String) filter.getValue())) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                case "album":
                    if (!song.getAlbum().equals(filter.getValue())) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                case "tags":
                    List<String> tags = (List<String>) filter.getValue();
                    if (!song.getTags().containsAll(tags)) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                case "lyrics":
                    if (!song.getLyrics().contains((String) filter.getValue())) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                case "genre":
                    if (!song.getGenre().equalsIgnoreCase((String) filter.getValue())) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                case "releaseyear":
                    if (!song.getReleaseYear().equals(Integer.parseInt((String) filter.getValue()))) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                case "artist":
                    if (!song.getArtist().equalsIgnoreCase((String) filter.getValue())) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    break;
                // Add other cases as necessary
                default:
                    // Handle unknown filter
                    break;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

In this implementation:

    searchSongs filters the list of songs by applying the matchesFilters method to each song.
    matchesFilters checks each filter against the corresponding property of the Song object. For example, it checks if the song's name contains the string specified in the name filter, if the album matches the album filter, and so on.
    This implementation assumes that the filter values are of appropriate types (e.g., String for most, List<String> for tags). You might need to add error handling or type checking depending on how the filters are provided.
    The method returns a list of song names that match all the provided filters.

Make sure to adapt the implementation to match the actual structure and data types of your Song class. The logic inside matchesFilters should be in accordance with how you want each filter to apply (e.g., exact match, partial match, case sensitivity).
